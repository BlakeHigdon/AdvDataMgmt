This project was completed as apart of WGU's Advanced Data Management course. 

I was tasked with creating my own business problem to solve using this data set. I came up with the basic problem of "forecasting inventory is hard" and my solution was to collect actor statistics, such as average rental time and total rental using the data, to help the business owners make more informed purchasing decisions. 

My in depth write up is included in the word document ("adm write up bh.docx") in this folder alongside the ER model ("ER model.jpg") for the data set. 

The database file is in zip format ( dvdrental.zip) so you need to extract it to  dvdrental.tar before loading the sample database into the PostgreSQL database server.

The SQL code I used is found within "SQL.txt".
